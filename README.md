This project involves creating a website for recipes using HTML. Through this exercise, I will demonstrate:

1) Creating directories. Seperating certain file types to specific folders and leaving the index.html in the main directory by itself.
2) The basic HTML boilerplate for each html file.
3) Proper use of headings depending on the importance of each section.
4) Writing paragraphs, ordered lists, unordred lists. 
5) Adding images to each html file, and how to link to the img directory. 
6) Creating general links on the main page to navigate through the website, including links to the homepage on each seperate page.
